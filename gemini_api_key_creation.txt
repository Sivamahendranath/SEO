🔑 Gemini API Key Setup Guide
This guide helps you create and use a Gemini API key to access Google's Generative AI services, such as Gemini 1.5 models.

📌 Prerequisites
A Google account

Access to Google AI Studio

Basic knowledge of Python (if you’re using the API with Python)

🚀 Steps to Create a Gemini API Key
1. Go to Google AI Studio
Visit:
👉 https://aistudio.google.com/app

This is where you can experiment with Gemini models and create API keys.

2. Sign In with Google
Use your Google account to log in.

3. Create or Open a Project
Click on your profile icon (top-right)

Choose "API keys" from the menu

4. Generate a New API Key
Click "Create API Key"

A new key will be generated (copy it!)

Store it securely (do not share it publicly)

🛡️ Important Notes
Keep your API key private

You can regenerate or delete keys anytime

Google may charge for usage, depending on quotas and tiers (check your plan)

🧪 Using the API Key in Python
Install the official library (if available) or use HTTP requests:

pip install google-generativeai
🔧 Example Setup in Python:
python

import google.generativeai as genai

genai.configure(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

model = genai.GenerativeModel("gemini-pro")
response = model.generate_content("Tell me a joke")
print(response.text)
